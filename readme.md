# Infinite Text Producing Machine
## Description 
This is a simple project that generates an endless text spitting machine using timestamps and hasing that provides non-repeating and non-recurring texts as each time stamp is unique.

The code may be used for simple purposes:
  - generating an infinite machine that runs forever and provides texts.
  - a simple random password
  - can be used to generate texts that are placeholders 
  - for stress testing software that requires very heavy texts.
  - as an unique id generator for games and for other reasons.
  - and whenever we simply require very long texts.


The generator is lightweight, requires **no external dependencies**, and can run indefinitely.
